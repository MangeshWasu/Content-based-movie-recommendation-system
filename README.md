# Content-based-movie-recommendation-system

My project entitled "Movie Recommendation System" aims to suggest or recommend the movie on the
basis of  similar movies.

It is a content based recommendation system which recommends likable movies using cosine similarity.
One of the important part of the project is feature engineering, lots of feature engineering has done to get
the proper results.

Here i have used OneHotEncoder, cosine similarity , python and different python libraries.
